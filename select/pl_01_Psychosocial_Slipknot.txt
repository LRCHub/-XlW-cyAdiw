Yeah!
I did my time, and I want out!
So abusive faith!
It doesn't cut, this soul is
not so vibrant.
The reckoning, the sickening.
Back at your subversion.
Pseudo-sacred sick before dawn.
Go to your deserts, go dig your
graves!
Then fill your mouth with all
the money you will save.
Sinking in, getting smaller
again.
I'm done! It has begun, I'm not
the only one!
And the rain will kill us all.
Throw ourselves against the
wall.
But no-one else can see.
The preservation of the martyr
in me.
Psychosocial, Psychosocial,
Psychosocial.
Psychosocial, Psychosocial,
Psychosocial.
There are cracks in the road we
lay.
But we're the devil filth, the
secret death gone mad.
This is nothing new, but would
we kill it all?
The hate was all we had!
Who needs another mess, we
could start over.
Just look me in the eyes and
say I'm wrong!
Now there's only emptiness,
burn elicit self threat.
I think we're done, I'm not the
only one!
And the rain will kill us all.
Throw ourselves against the
wall.
But no-one else can see.
The preservation of the martyr
in me.
Psychosocial, Psychosocial,
Psychosocial.
Psychosocial, Psychosocial,
Psychosocial.
The limits of the dead!
The limits of the dead!
The limits of the dead!
The limits of the dead!
Fake anti-fascist lie
(Psychosocial)
I've tried to tell you thrice!
(Psychosocial)
Your hurtful lies are giving
out. (Psychosocial)
Can't stop the killing, I can't
help it. (Psychosocial)
If it's something secret.
(Psychosocial)
Is this what you want?
(Psychosocial)
I'm not the only one!
And the rain will kill us all.
Throw ourselves against the
wall.
But no-one else can see.
The preservation of the martyr
in me.
And the rain will kill us all.
Throw ourselves against the
wall.
But no-one else can see.
The preservation of the martyr
in me.
The limits of the dead!
The limits of the dead!
