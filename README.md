[00:22.27] Ooh, yeah!
[00:27.27] 
[00:36.62] I did my time, and I want out
[00:40.03] So effusive fade, it doesn't cut
[00:43.53] The soul is not so vibrant
[00:45.68] The reckoning, the sickening
[00:48.65] Packaging subversion
[00:50.29] Pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
[01:04.29] 
[00:52.84] Go drill your deserts
[00:54.59] Go dig your graves
[00:56.37] Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
[00:59.48] Sinking in, getting smaller again
[01:02.48] I'm done, it has begun
[01:04.80] I'm not the only one
[01:14.80] 
[01:07.53] And the rain will kill us all
[01:11.47] Throw ourselves against the wall
[01:14.97] But no one else can see
[01:17.96] The preservation of the martyr in me
[01:35.96] 
[01:21.72] Psychosocial!
[01:23.54] Psychosocial!
[01:25.32] Psychosocial!
[01:28.87] Psychosocial!
[01:30.61] Psychosocial!
[01:32.55] Psychosocial!
[01:39.05] 
[01:33.98] Oh, there are cracks in the road we laid
[01:36.73] But where the temple fell
[01:38.49] The secrets have gone mad
[01:42.25] This is nothing new
[01:43.86] But when we killed it all
[01:45.71] The hate was all we had
[01:57.21] 
[01:49.38] Who needs another mess?
[01:50.97] We could start over
[01:52.39] Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
[01:56.11] Now there's only emptiness
[01:57.90] Venomous, insipid
[02:00.22] I think we're done
[02:01.59] I'm not the only one
[02:11.59] 
[02:04.46] And the rain will kill us all
[02:08.22] Throw ourselves against the wall
[02:11.63] But no one else can see
[02:14.75] The preservation of the martyr in me
[02:32.75] 
[02:18.50] Psychosocial!
[02:20.31] Psychosocial!
[02:22.14] Psychosocial!
[02:25.60] Psychosocial!
[02:27.34] Psychosocial!
[02:29.22] Psychosocial!
[02:35.72] 
[02:59.47] The limits of the dead!
[03:10.97] 
[03:06.31] The limits of the dead!
[03:17.81] 
[03:13.53] The limits of the dead!
[03:25.03] 
[03:20.82] The limits of the dead!
[03:32.32] 
[03:29.13] Fake anti-fascist lie (psychosocial!)
[03:31.51] I tried to tell you, but (psychosocial!)
[03:33.14] Your purple hearts are giving out (psychosocial!)
[03:36.48] Can't stop a killing idea (psychosocial!)
[03:38.60] If it's hunting season (psychosocial!)
[03:40.38] Is this what you want? (Psychosocial!)
[03:42.08] I'm not the only one!
[03:52.58] 
[03:44.75] And the rain will kill us all
[03:48.44] We throw ourselves against the wall
[03:52.19] But no one else can see
[03:55.14] The preservation of the martyr in me
[04:13.14] 
[03:58.91] And the rain will kill us all
[04:02.79] We throw ourselves against the wall
[04:06.35] But no one else can see
[04:09.42] The preservation of the martyr in me
[04:27.42] 
[04:25.22] The limits of the dead!
[04:36.72] 
[04:32.14] The limits of the dead!
